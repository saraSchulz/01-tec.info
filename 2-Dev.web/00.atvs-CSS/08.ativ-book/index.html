                        headline for your email, website or product... but nothing really happens? Wouldn’t it be great
                        to just skip that?

                    Quickly, word spread around town, and a few co-workers asked us if we could share this “secret”
                    collection of converting headlines with them. We did. They tested some of our headlines and saw some
                    <span>very positive</span> results with these headlines as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They were blown away by the massive impact a headline could make. This success inspired us to share
                    our collection of <span>200 headlines</span> with everyone.
